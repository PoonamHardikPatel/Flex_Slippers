            Footwear refers to garments worn on the feet, which typically serves the purpose of protection
            against adversities of the environment such as wear from ground textures and temperature.
            Footwear in the manner of shoes therefore primarily serves the purpose to ease locomotion and
            prevent injuries. Footwear can also be used for fashion and adornment as well as to indicate
            the status or rank of the person within a social structure.

        <p>
            A corporate headquarters (HQ) is a place where a company's executive management and key managerial
            and support staff are located. A corporate headquarters is considered a business's most important
            location and may also lend prestige to its host city and help attract other businesses to the area.
        </p>
        <p>
            Businesses frequently locate their corporate headquarters in and around large cities because of the
            greater business opportunities, access to talent, infrastructure, and services they offer.

        <p>
            <b>Slippers</b> are light footwear that are easy to put on and off and are intended to be worn
            indoors, particularly at home. They provide comfort and protection for the feet when walking indoors.
            Not all shoes with a soft fluffy interior are slippers. Any shoe with a rubber sole and laces is a
            normal outdoor shoe. In India, rubber chappals (flip-flops) are worn as indoor shoes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some slippers are made to resemble something other than a slipper and are sold as a novelty item. The 
            slippers are usually made from soft and colorful materials and may come in the shapes of animals, 
            animal paws, vehicles, cartoon characters, etc.
